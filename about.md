I draw on Linux. The software I use is [Krita](https://krita.org/en/). It's free, open source, multi platform and easy to use.

I don't have any special education. I'm completely self-taught, using some articles, books, videos and a lot of trial-and-error.

Most of my inspiration comes from video games. A very limited set of video games. Once I acquire an adequate experience in this, I'll probably shift to something else. My learning path may be weird and illogical, but this is my own unique story that I create myself.
 
This is why I created this little webpage. I want to keep track of my progress and see how I (hopefully) evolve. It is interesting to see right now and it will be even more interesting as the things go on.

I know very well that I am only a beginner. Sometimes I fail and maybe I won't even achieve some of this things that I want to achieve.

But I'll keep trying.
